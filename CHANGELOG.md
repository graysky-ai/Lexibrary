# Changelog

All notable changes to Lexibrary are documented in this file.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-02

### Removed
- **`lexi orient` command** -- Removed the orient command, service modules (`orient.py`, `orient_render.py`), and the `lexi-orient` skill template. Session start now uses `TOPOLOGY.md` for project layout and `lexi iwh list` for pending signals instead of the orient command.
- **`orientation_tokens` config** -- Removed from `TokenBudgetConfig` schema and default config since the orient command no longer exists.
- **`docs/agent/orientation.md`** -- Deleted; session start protocol is now documented in `quick-reference.md` and agent rule files.

### Changed
- **Agent rules and templates** -- Updated `CLAUDE.md`, core rules template, and agent templates (explore, plan, code) to replace `lexi orient` with reading `TOPOLOGY.md` and running `lexi iwh list`.
- **Documentation** -- Updated README, agent docs, and user docs to remove orient references and reflect the new session start workflow.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Topology generation** — Agent-navigable `TOPOLOGY.md` produced from raw topology data, with directory trees, billboard summaries, and navigation prose

- **Skills restructure** — Skills migrated from flat `.md` files to structured `SKILL.md` directories (`lexi-concepts`, `lexi-lookup`, `lexi-orient`, `lexi-search`, `lexi-stack`)
- **Skills mirror test** — Ensures skill templates stay in sync with registered skills
- **Context allocation config** — New `context_allocation` config field for controlling token budget distribution

### Changed

- **Index generator** — Refactored context allocation logic in `indexer/generator.py` for better token budget handling

### Removed
